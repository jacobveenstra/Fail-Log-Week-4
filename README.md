# Fail-Log-Week-4
Exercise 1

I was easily able to download gephi and put in the Texas corresponence data into the application 

After copying the information to the label column, ive ran into a problem. 

the instructions said I should have 234 nodes and 394 edges. Instead I have 234 nodes and 982 edges.

i have tried redoing all the steps but have had no luck figuring out why my edges is that high...I will continue working away

used the forceatlas 2 layout for my information

when i got to the step where I am supposed to filter out everything but the giant component, I followed all the steps and pressed filter but nothing visual happeend on the screen...unsure if this is supposed to happen or if something was done wrong.

did the step that added the "pagerank" with no problems
