# Fail-Log-Week-4
Exercise 1

I was easily able to download gephi and put in the Texas corresponence data into the application 

After copying the information to the label column, ive ran into a problem. 

the instructions said I should have 234 nodes and 394 edges. Instead I have 234 nodes and 982 edges.

i have tried redoing all the steps but have had no luck figuring out why my edges is that high...I will continue working away

used the forceatlas 2 layout for my information

when i got to the step where I am supposed to filter out everything but the giant component, I followed all the steps and pressed filter but nothing visual happeend on the screen...unsure if this is supposed to happen or if something was done wrong.

did the step that added the "pagerank" with no problems

finished all the steps of the exercise and saved my finished product. When trying to upload it to my github it would only come up as a blank page. going to try and figure out how to post the file. 

Found out that i was trying to save it instead of export it and that was the problem 

Excerise 2

Im struggling to save the files in the right format

saved them in txt but wont open in the application 

Professor Graham was able to give me help. I just needed to save the file in a folder of its own.

was able to go through the exercise very easily after this. 

i will probably use thus application for my final project...just need to way an interesting way to use it for the final
